Deloitte Cyber <> Vertex,"About Deloitte Tohmatsu Cyber (""DTC"") DTC Japan office was established in Apr 2019 as a part of global DTC. 200 staff in Japan and 7,000+ globally. Red team in Japan has 10 members Covers wide range of cybersecurity services including cybersecurity consulting, regulatory compliance advice, managed service (Cyber Intelligence Center), pentesting, Forensic service, research and development, etc. Applies a collaborative approach and actively seeking for overseas cybersecurity startups which may complement their offerings. Focuses on operations rather than high level strategy consulting. Interests Axonius: DTC thinks there's a strong market demand although they need to examine the addressable size as DTC. Mr. Hoshizawa has met Tanium before when he was with PwC Cybersecurity. Tanium is said to be Axonius's competitor and already established office in Japan and now growing with focus on enterprise segment. It is a suite solution and quite costly, so if Axonius can offer a lower price, DTC is keen to explore partnerships Cymulate, VGS and Cyberhaven: Couldn't go deep enough, but interested in all of them in general. -> Takaki to send corp deck of abovementioned companies and follow up accordinglyüö©"
Cymulate | Standard Chartered Follow-up,"Hey Brian, Thanks for reaching out. Good bumping into you at the coffee shop the other day. Glad that everything is well. Let me forward this to my ICS folks to see if there is any interest. Will circle back to you. Sorry about the late response, I have just switched roles recently to do digital sales/biz planning for our bancassurance business and have been a little snowed under. Looking forwards to catching up again. I‚Äôm hopeful that the situation is showing signs of abating. Cheers JT From: Brian TOH <btoh@vertexholdings.com> Sent: Sunday, June 20, 2021 9:37 PMTo: Cheng, Jin Tong <Jintong.Cheng@sc.com>Cc: Arman Aymond <arman.aymond@vertexholdings.com>Subject: [External] Standard Chartered | Introduction to Cymulate | 20.6.2021 ATTENTION: This email came from an external source. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or unexpected emails. Always report suspicious emails using the Report As Phishing button in Outlook to protect the Bank and our clients. Jin Tong, Trust you and your loved ones are keeping well. Would like to introduce Cymulate \- a leading Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platform invested by Vertex Israel and Vertex Growth Fund. Given the geopolitical patina of cyberattacks today, Cymulate‚Äôs platform resonates with its users across an array of industry verticals, including governments, FIs (Bank of Israel, Llyod‚Äôs, CDPQ, etc.) and leading exchanges including Euronext: Cymulate is an automated BAS platform that enables users to easily assess and validate the cybersecurity control across its network infrastructure, including email gateway, web gateway, WAF, endpoints, data filtration, etc. Its platform can assess the system‚Äôs readiness against immediate threats found in the ‚Äòwild‚Äô, with simulated attack modules made available within days of threat discovery. Cymulate also has various advanced modules, including automated phishing awareness tool, lateral movement path simulation, broad search of potential external threat (reconnaissance) as well as first-in industry purple team capability. The tests are fully customisable and automated ‚Äì enabling continuous security validation. Besides identifying gaps, Cymulate also generates management and technical reports with detailed mitigation suggestions. Fast and simple implementation ‚Äì cloud-based service (compatible w/ Windows, macOS and Linux) requiring only the installation of one client on each network environment.  The Cymulate platform is integrated with most of the major security system providers, including vulnerability scanner (VS), DAST, SIEM, SOAR, EDR, NTA, etc. ‚Äì enabling it to validate the end-to-end cybersecurity posture of the user. At Vertex Holdings, we adopted Cymulate‚Äôs platform since 4Q2019. It is regularly used to apprise our Board and management on our cybersecurity posture. Please find attached a sample of the reports generated automatically by the platform each time it is run: a general executive report and an endpoint security technical report, together with other introductory material. Cymulate was recently recognised by Frost and Sullivan as the No.1 Innovation Leader in BAS ‚Äì we attach here the assessment report by the SANS Institute for your reference. Cymulate is employed by the Bank of Israel and more recently selected by Taiwan Exchange as its solution. We will be delighted to address any queries from SC‚Äôs cybersecurity team. Alternatively, we could also arrange a demo with Cymulate if preferred.  Do let us know how this sounds to you and pls feel free to reach out if there‚Äôs anything else we may be of service in the interim. Look forward to catching up with you over coffee/makan once the COVID-19 situation abates. Would also introduce you to my colleague Arman who covers our European partnerships. Brian"
