NEW YORK, and TEL AVIV, Israel , Dec. 6, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Cymulate, the market leader in Threat Exposure Assessment and Cybersecurity Controls Validation, today announced a new technology integration with Trend Micro, a global cybersecurity leader, which reduces risk related to cyber threats. In addition to joining the Trend Micro Vision One ecosystem partner program, the company has completed the technology integration of its cybersecurity risk validation and exposure management solution with the Trend Micro Vision One XDR platform. The collaboration will correlate simulated attacks with ongoing events and alerts, enhancing the security control environment and management against malicious behavior and real and simulated malware. Today's malicious actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their execution of attacks. As a result, organizations must have measures in place to protect their network and ensure they are constantly monitoring their environment for new threats.
Together, the integrated Cymulate and Trend Micro Vision One XDR solution provides comprehensive protection against cyber threats and strengthens an organization's security posture with the following benefits:

Automated and continuous security validation across the entire attack kill-chain
Ongoing simulation that operationalizes the MITRE ATT&CK framework
Creating auto remediation playbooks to new threats and attack vectors
Configuration of Trend Micro's XDR policies to Cymulate's actionable remediation guidance

""Cyberattacks are not showing any signs of slowing down and need a united front from security providers to combat them,"" said Carolyn Crandall, chief security advocate at Cymulate. ""We are delighted to be partnering with Trend Micro so that businesses can better understand any weaknesses in their security posture and optimize their existing security infrastructure to better protect their organizations."" ""Security validation is an essential step for organizations to take towards cyber resilience,"" said Jon Clay, vice president of threat intelligence at Trend Micro. ""Integrating our solutions with Cymulate is an exciting milestone for us. This new offering will significantly strengthen the risk assessment capability and provide enhanced seamless protection for mission-critical environments through ongoing simulated attacks deployed alongside events and alerts coming from Trend Micro.""
Cymulate's platform is recognized for its ability to continuously test a business's security posture against immediate threats and to validate whether security controls are functioning properly to stop in-network activities tied to execution methods, OS manipulation, data manipulation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and other actions that inform on how bad the incursion or breach might be. The breadth and depth of this platform have earned it recognition as the gold standard for continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) programs, an emerging security program that was coined by Gartner, Inc.

Cymulate's continuous risk validation and exposure management protects and benchmarks customer readiness against cyber threats NEW YORK, and TEL AVIV, Israel , Dec. 6, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Cymulate , the market leader in Threat Exposure Assessment and Cybersecurity Controls Validation, today announced a new technology integration with Trend Micro , a global cybersecurity leader, which reduces risk related to cyber threats. In addition to joining the Trend Micro Vision One ecosystem partner program, the company has completed the technology integration of its cybersecurity risk validation and exposure management solution with the Trend Micro Vision One XDR platform. The collaboration will correlate simulated attacks with ongoing events and alerts, enhancing the security control environment and management against malicious behavior and real and simulated malware. Today's malicious actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their execution of attacks. As a result, organizations must have measures in place to protect their network and ensure they are constantly monitoring their environment for new threats. Together, the integrated Cymulate and Trend Micro Vision One XDR solution provides comprehensive protection against cyber threats and strengthens an organization's security posture with the following benefits: Automated and continuous security validation across the entire attack kill-chain

Ongoing simulation that operationalizes the MITRE ATT&CK framework

Creating auto remediation playbooks to new threats and attack vectors

Configuration of Trend Micro's XDR policies to Cymulate's actionable remediation guidance ""Cyberattacks are not showing any signs of slowing down and need a united front from security provider to combat them,"" said Carolyn Crandall, chief security advocate at Cymulate. ""We are delighted to be partnering with Trend Micro so that businesses can better understand any weaknesses in their security posture and optimize their existing security infrastructure to better protect their organizations.""



""Security validation is an essential step for organizations to take towards cyber resilience,"" said Jon Clay, vice president of threat intelligence at Trend Micro. ""Integrating our solutions with Cymulate is an exciting milestone for us. This new offering will significantly strengthen the risk assessment capability and provide enhanced seamless protection for mission-critical environments through ongoing simulated attacks deployed alongside events and alerts coming from Trend Micro."" Cymulate's platform is recognized for its ability to continuously test a business's security posture against immediate threats and to validate whether security controls are functioning properly to stop in-network activities tied to execution methods, OS manipulation, data manipulation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and other actions that inform on how bad the incursion or breach might be. The breadth and depth of this platform have earned it recognition as the gold standard for continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) programs, an emerging security program that was coined by Gartner, Inc.

LONDON, December 06, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--One Peak, a leading investor for growth stage B2B software companies in Europe and Israel, is excited to announce the closing of One Peak Growth III at its hard cap of $1 billion.

David Klein, Co-founder and Managing Partner, said: ""We are ultimately in the business of investing in exceptional founders, and we work alongside them with the same passion and dedication as they do. Our value-add is significantly enhanced by our fully integrated Value Creation Team, particularly when it comes to hiring the best talent, accelerating top line growth, driving global expansion, and improving product and technology capabilities. This is a key differentiator for our portfolio companies in building generational companies. Last but not least, we are grateful to our founders and LPs from around the globe for their continued trust.""

83,One Peak scales up and closes $1B fund aimed at European and Israeli growth rounds,Ingrid Lunden,2022-12-06 09:33:01,full,https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/06/one-peak-scales-up-and-closes-1b-fund-aimed-at-european-and-israeli-growth-rounds/,techcrunch.com,"This is the 8-year-old firm's biggest fund, and One Peak will invest between $15m and $100m in growth rounds for B2B startups.","There's a prevailing logic (or you might say hope) in tech that says there is no better time to invent and invest than when the market appears to be in a bad place. With companies like Google and Apple born out of fallow periods, that way of thinking may be understandable — and it is leading to a number of fresh venture funds, pushing capital into the market.
In the latest development, One Peak, a firm out of London that focuses on growth stage rounds in B2B startups across Europe and Israel — is today announcing that it has closed its latest, and biggest-ever fund of $1 billion.
The fund is the third from eight-year-old One Peak. First launched in March of this year, One Peak described the $1 billion ‘hard cap' as oversubscribed and now the largest focused on B2B software companies in Europe. It plans to use the money to invest between $15 million and $100 million in growth rounds.
One Peak's portfolio includes the likes of Cymulate, PandaDoc, DataGuard, Paysend, Deepki, Neo4j and Spryker — a list focused on scaling enterprise startups across a range of categories like cybersecurity, e-commerce, and data management and analytics — and the plan is both to continue doubling down on those while also looking for others to join the stable.
David Klein, who co-founded One Peak with Humbert de Liedekerke Beaufort, believes that even with global markets contracting and expected to continue that pattern next year, B2B tech will continue to remain a 'recession-proof' category, in his words.
And contrary to its name, One Peak is not alone in that line of thought. Even as we look at how prices for tech stocks are crashing, and anecdotally and verifiably are seeing evidence of investors and startups talking about the lack of activity and pressure on the market, ironically, compared to the rest of the market, investors (and in the case of venture funds, LPs) appear to be putting more of their money into tech, a category they see longer term outperforming the rest of the market.
Beaufort notes that while there is definitely a slowdown in the wider market and the sales cycles in B2B — a category some believe will also be hit, but perhaps in a more delayed way — 'Currently we've seen no impact on the performance of our companies,' he said.
One Peak's $1 billion fund III comes amid a number of other VCs raising capital this year both in Europe and further afield. EQT Ventures has closed two different funds in the last couple of months, $2.2 billion for growth-stage investments mostly in Europe and a further $1 billion for early-stage bets. Index Ventures has committed $300 million in the last month specifically to fund new startups in the downturn. Northzone also announced its latest fund, a record $1 billion for the firm, in the last quarter. Atomico is also reportedly raising $1.3 billion in new funds this year, although the close of those has not been confirmed.
Dealroom analysis notes that in all, the first three quarters of 2022 saw VCs in EMEA raise some $24 billion in funds. Meanwhile, PitchBook analysis found that nearly $151 billion was raised by U.S.-based firms in the first three quarters of this year, although it also pointed out that deal-making out of that money was not matching that exuberance.
The message is clear: those looking to make money out of their money may see tech as a relatively safe harbor, but those who hold the purse strings are generally being a lot more cautious how they distribute those funds.
One Peak is following some of that pattern itself.
'We believe multiples are down to 2018 levels,' said Beaufort. Klein added that the highest-growth companies are reasonable investments at 12-13 times the revenue run rate. And he added that the firm recently passed on at least one big deal that's in the works because the valuation multiple — 20 times the revenue run rate — was just too high.

85,The changing role of the MITRE ATT@CK framework,Jon Oltsik,2022-12-06 11:00:00,timezone unknown,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3681990/the-changing-role-of-the-mitre-att-ck-framework.html,csoonline.com,"Organizations are using the MITRE ATT@CK framework as more than a security operations reference architecture, adding new use cases and making it part of strategic future plans.","Since its creation in 2013, the MITRE ATT&CK framework has been of interest to security operations professionals. In the early years, the security operations center (SOC) team used MITRE as a reference architecture, comparing alerts and threat intelligence nuggets with the taxonomy's breakdown of adversary tactics and techniques. Based on ESG research, MITRE ATT&CK usage has reached an inflection point. Security teams not only recognize its value as a security operations foundation but also want to build upon this foundation with more use cases and greater benefits.After nine years, MITRE ATT&CK and its use cases have evolved well beyond a reference architecture. In many ways, MITRE ATT&CK has become a 'lingua franca' of security operations. According to ESG research, 48% of organizations say they use the MITRE ATT&CK framework 'extensively' for security operations while another 41% use it on a limited basis. When asked how important MITRE ATT&CK is for their future security operations strategy, the results were even more impressive. Nineteen percent claim that MITRE ATT&CK is critical, 62% say it's very important, and 15% believe MITRE ATT&CK is an important component of their security operations strategy.New MITRE ATT@CK use casesWhy are so many organizations embracing MITRE ATT&CK? In a holiday spirit, MITRE ATT&CK is a gift that keeps on giving. ESG research reveals that organizations are using MITRE ATT&CK for several use cases. For example:
Thirty-eight percent of organizations use MITRE ATT&CK to help them apply threat intelligence into their alert triage and investigations processes. This is a basic use case, but it can really help SOC teams enrich alerts and gives them a blueprint for what else to look for.
Thirty-Seven percent of organizations use MITRE ATT&CK as a guideline for security engineering. Engineers use the framework to map out targeted adversary campaigns and then implement the right security controls, detection rules, and countermeasures in the right places.
Thirty-five percent of organizations use MITRE ATT&CK to better understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPS) of adversaries. If you work in the SOC team of a western government agency, you should be concerned about nation state threats like APT 29. The MITRE ATT&CK navigator can be used to isolate and present the TTPs used in specific cyber-attacks like this. SOC teams can then assess their controls and data sources, identify blind spots and weaknesses, and use these insights to reinforce defenses.
Thirty-four percent of organizations use MITRE ATT&CK to understand the full extent of cyber-attacks. Armed with the framework, analysts can map individual alerts to what happened in the past and what may happen in the future. This is the difference between individual alert triage and full-blown threat forensics and investigations.
Thirty-three percent of organizations use MITRE ATT&CK to supplement the threat intelligence provided by their security technology vendors. Endpoint detection and response (EDR), network detection and response (NDR), DNS services, and email gateways all integrate threat intelligence for alerting and blocking suspicious activities, but they do so on a siloed technology basis. MITRE ATT&CK can help weave these individual pixels into a much more detailed threat picture.
The future of MITRE ATT@CK usageSo, where does MITRE usage go next? Allow me to prognosticate a bit:
MITRE ATT&CK use will drive more continuous security testing. MITRE ATT&CK already raised the value of threat intelligence by helping companies map atomic indicators and alerts to extended kill chains. Similarly, I believe MITRE ATT&CK will also drive the mainstreaming of continuous security testing. There is already alignment in these two areas with open-source tools like Red Canary's Atomic Red team. I believe increased MITRE ATT&CK knowledge and use cases will also drive more adoption of commercial continuous testing tools like those from AttackIQ, Cymulate, IBM (Randori), Mandiant (Verodin), and SafeBeach.
Startups will focus on helping organizations operationalize MITRE ATT&CK. While many organizations want to operationalize MITRE ATT&CK, they may not have the skills or integrated software stack to maximize this effort. Given the ubiquity of MITRE ATT&CK, it's likely that a bevy of startups will appear, aimed at bridging this gap. Some already exist like Tidal Cyber, a company founded by ex-MITRE employees for this very purpose.
Organizations will look more intently at other MITRE projects. Based on the success of MITRE ATT&CK, CISOs and SOC teams will be more open to looking at other MITRE projects like MITRE D3fend (A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures) and MITRE Engage (a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement and operations). MITRE Engage may also act as a catalyst for jumpstarting the dormant deception technology market.
